# Clamp Calculator

Clamp calculator can be used to calculate the preferred value for the clamp() function, with the format:

`clamp(min_size, preferred_value, max_size)`

where,

    min_size = font-size/width/height/etc at minimum viewport width/height
    max_size = font-size/width/height/etc at maximum viewport width/height

The method used for calculating the preferred value is as explained here: <https://css-tricks.com/linearly-scale-font-size-with-css-clamp-based-on-the-viewport/>.
